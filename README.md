### Project Description
In a fast-paced and busy world, people often face challenges in staying organized and managing their time effectively. Forgetting important tasks, missing deadlines, and struggling to prioritize activities are common issues that negatively impact productivity and lead to stress. Existing tools for task management are often too complex or rigid, making them unsuitable for many users‚Äô daily routines. This creates a demand for a user-friendly and adaptable solution that enables individuals to plan their day, set reminders, and receive notifications in a way that seamlessly integrates into their lifestyle, helping them stay on track and achieve their goals.
